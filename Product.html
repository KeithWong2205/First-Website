			<summary><b>Oil</b></summary>
			<p>Engine oil is the most popular product in servicing your ride, and choosing the right or wrong ones will be the most vital decision for keeping your ride safe and strong.</p>
			<p>For most of the motorcycle that are below 175cc in displacement, the viscosity rating should be around 30 to 40 for newly bought bikes and between 40 to 50 for bike that have ran over 50,000km in total</p>
			<p>There are 3 most popular type of oils: Mineral, Semi-Synthetics (Synthetic Blended, Blended) and Fully Synthetics. For best economy, you would want to go with Semi-Synthetics since it is cheaper than the Full Synthetics but performs better than the Mineral. But if you are a performance enthusiast, then you should always go for Full Synthetics, with Ester grade if available, since they are the best in performance but also are pretty expensive.</p>

			<summary><b>Coolants</b></summary>
			<p>Coolant, though is not replaced very frequently is still a very important thing that you should give attention on after a while of riding. It is the only thing to help circulate the heat from your engine to the radiator, keeping the engine from over heat and keeping you comfortable when you ride.</p>

			<p>Choosing the coolant for your ride, you should always go for propylene glycol that have no silicates or phosphates additives to ensure best heat extrction and radiator proection. If you want to go for a Trackday, choose the one that does not have any glycol in it.</p>

			<summary><b>Brake Fluids</b></summary>
			<p>Brake fluid is the thing that will determine whether you will be safe or not on the road, so always pay high attention to when you should change it.</p>
			<p>Brake fluid have a tendency to absorb moisture from the air so always use moderate amount and seal packages so that you won't waste fluids and money. Always pay close attention to the guiding of your manual to choose the right type of fluids, in our case with the M-Slaz, it will be DOT3 or DOT4</p>

			<summary><b>Brake Pads</b></summary>
			<p>Brake pad is the next most important thing to consider during a brake sevice, since it is what gives you friction and stops you from hitting what is in front of you.</p>
			<p>For casual riding and commuting, using simple orgainc pads is enough for you, but for maximum safety during normal commuting and long trip, using a sintered or a compounded pad will be better for both mileage and performance.</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Suggested</summary>
				<p>Recommended brand and model: EBC Brake Pad, Organic ECE R90 pads, V-pads Semi-Sintered (for best economy), H-pads Sintered (best braking performance)</p>
