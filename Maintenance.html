		<p>In this section, I will guide us through the steps to take care of many performance parts of our bikes. The techniques that I provide here are all based on my experience and things I learnt over time from many people.</p>
		<p>You can find your way to the home page through the picture on the left. Now, you can explore everything about maintenance and servicing for your ride below.</p>
		<p>In regard to the environment, please recycle your oil fluids, don't dump it out irresponsibly, and please put all trash into its places.</p>
		<p>First of will be fluid changes, please keep in mind that you should always keep your bike clear of any fluid, since any type of fluid inside your bike is harmful for the outside of your bike. Please cover your paintwork carefully, oil with get sticky, and coolant and brake fluid can damage your paint.</p>
		<p>P.s: Pictures will be provided later</p>

	<h3>Oil Change</h3>
	<section class="oil">
	<p>Changing your oil is the most well-known part of servicing your ride, and it is relatively easy as well. I will guide you through the many steps of doing this maintenance job. Most type of oil will require you to replace them after 1000km of riding, but some choices (like my setup) will gives you power even after 3000km but you still should replace it after 3000km. Check your Odometer regularly and keep a maintenance sheet handy. After 10,000km you should do a engine flush to remove the oil contaminant inside your engine.</p>
	<p>First off, you will need to prepare some tools, preparation is key to a smooth going maintenance job since you won't be running around finding stuffs and leaving a messy working place behind.</p>
	<details>
		<summary>Things you will need</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>10mm wrench</li>
			<li>Drain pan</li>
			<li>Funnel</li>
			<li>New oil</li>
			<li>Plyer</li>
			<li>Old cloths</li>
			<li>Paper towels</li>
			<li>Latex gloves</li>
			<li>Engine flush (Motul or Liqui Moly)</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	<p>After you have prepared all of the tools from the list above, put your latex gloves on and get ready, this is gonna get dirty !</p>
	<details>
		<summary>Procedure</summary>
		<ol>
			<li>Find the drain bolt located at the bottom of the engine near the clutch housing</li>
			<li>Crack loose the drain bolt (Don't take it out just yet</li>
			<li>Place the drain pan underneath your engine to catch the oil (Add some cardboard surrounding if you need to) .</li>
			<li>Loosen and take the drain bolt off without dropping it into the drain pan.</li>
			<li>Let the oil flow out, crack open the oil filler cap at the clutch housing for more circulation.</li>
			<li>Replace the drain bolt, tighten it (check for the condition of the sealing washer, replace if needed).</li>
			<li>Fill in with the new oil, run the engine for 5 minutes, check again for oil level, fill in more if needed.</li>
			<li>(Starting from this step is for flushing your engine) Grab your engine flush fluid, pour it into the engine along with some cheap mineral oil.</li>
			<li>Go for a short drive of around 100-200km to get the flush fluid to run through the engine.</li>
			<li>Drain out the oil and fluids (Repeat this and the previous flushing steps 2 times)</li>
			<li>Pour in brand new fully synthetic oil.</li>
		</ol>

	<h3>Coolant Change</h3>
	<section class="Coolant">
		<p>Coolant is one of the three fluids in your motorcycle, and since all fluids have a date to be replaced, you should check on your coolant and replace it after a while of riding to keep the bike running cool and smooth. Coolant should be replace after about 2 years of casual riding, and 1 year of frequent racing and commuting. Coolant system should be flushed clean after 3-5 years of riding. Still it depends greatly on the weather condition of your country, mine is hot and dusty so it will be flushed every 2 years.</p>
		<details>
			<summary>Again, you will need these things</summary>
			<ul>
				<li>10mm wrench</li>
				<li>Drain pan</li>
				<li>Funnel</li>
				<li>Latex gloves</li>
				<li>New coolant</li>
				<li>Distiled water (a lot of these)</li>
				<li>Towels</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
		<p>Before we begin, I would like to give out some cautions, coolant that you choose should be a motorcycle specific coolant. Also, coolant are made with glycol so it is very poisonous to pet, if you have them, keep them away from the work space, coolant have a sweet taste and smell good to pet but it could kill them.</p>
		<details>
			<summary>Here are the steps for it</summary>
			<ol>
				<li>Make sure your bike is off, your engine is cold or at least cool to the touch and any fairings covering the radiator and coolant reservoir have been removed.</li>
				<li>Find the coolant hose that leads to the impeller, crack loose the very bottom bolt, that is the drain bolt.</li>
				<li>Place the drain pan underneath the bike to catch the coolant</li>
				<li>Take out the drain bolt and let the coolant flows out.</li>
				<li>Open the radiator cap slightly without removing it, this is to create circulation for better flow of fluid.</li>
				<li>Take the coolant reservoir out and drain out the old coolant.</li>
				<li>Replace the drain bolt and the reservoir, fill in with distiled water.</li>
				<li>Replace the radiator cap, run the engine for 5-10 minutes. Then flush out the dirty water. (Do this 1-2 times and replace the distiled water after each time to flush the system.</li>
				<li>Do the same as fill in the water, but this time, fill in with the new coolant.</li>
				<li>Clean up your working area carefully,</li>
			</ol>

	<h3>Brake Fluid Change</h3>
	<section class="fluid">
		<p>Brake fluid change is rather easy, and yet it is the most neglected fluid out of the three. Some people won't even change it at all and only focus on the brake pads, that is really dangerous. Brake fluids can absorb moisture, and when they do, they will be less effective, and needs to be replaced. Indicators are dark color, change in fluid level (reduction). </p>
		<details>
			<summary>First, preparation is key</summary>
			<ul>
				<li>Latex gloves</li>
				<li>Philips screwdriver</li>
				<li>Towels</li>
				<li>PVC tube or bleeding tools from MotionPro</li>
				<li>7mm wrench</li>
				<li>Container for old fluids</li>
				<li>New brake fluids according to manual</li>
				<li>Small syringes</li>
			</ul>
			</details>
			<p>Now, before we begin, please cover your bike carefully with towels, brake fluid can damage your paint. Small notes, these steps can be applied to both front and rear brake, just replace "lever" with "pedal"</p>
			<details>
				<summary>Let's get into it</summary>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the brake fluid reservoir cap with the philips screwdriver, keep it open slightly.</li>
					<li>Put the PVC (or bleeding tools) onto the drain hose of the caliper, keep the other end in the drain pan or container.</li>
					<li>Press against the brake lever a few times to build up some pressure (if you see a lot of rise in fluid level, use the syringe to suck some out to prevent spillage).</li>
					<li>Keep putting pressure on the brake lever, use the wrench to open the drain bolt, you will feel the lever become really slack, then wait for the flow for 20 seconds then tighten the drain bolt. (Repeat this steps until fluid level gets low enough)</li>
					<li>When fluid level in the reservoir is low enough, pour in the new brake fluids, keep repeating this and the previous step until the fluid coming out the tube is clear.</li>
					<li>When the fluid is clear, keep draining for all the air to be release from the brake system, until you see continuous fluid flow, tighten the drain bolt, remove the PVC tube (bleeding tools) carefully to avoid splattering</li>
					<li>Fill the reservoir to the marked area and close it tightly.</li>
				</ol>

	<h3>Brake Pads Change</h3>
	<section class="pads">
	<p>Keeping an eye out for your brake pads will keep you safe during your ride, stops you from hitting other things and give you good stopping power in case of emergency. Brake pads have a wear indicator marked on the pads (the small grooves), when you don't see them anymore, that mean it's time to replace them.</p>
	<details>
		<summary>It will be quite messy so prepare yourself</summary>
		<ul>
			<li>Small tray to carry small parts that will be taken out</li>
			<li>Wrenches, allen keys, flat head screwdriver</li>
			<li>New brake pads (Refer to my recommendation)</li>
			<li>Latex gloves</li>
		</ul>
	</details>
	<p>Please remember to keep all out your part in order since there will be many small parts involved in this maintenance. These steps will be applied for both front and rear brake.</p>
	<details>
		<summary>Steps to do</summary>
		<ol>
			<li>Remove the caliper from the wheels</li>
			<li>Remove locating pivot pins in the caliper</li>
			<li>Remove the locating caliper spring</li>
			<li>Take out the old pads</li>
			<li>Press slightly on the piston to slide in the new brake pads easier (pay attention to how the pads was placed and follow it).</li>
			<li>Put back the locating spring and pivot pins</li>
			<li>Re-install the caliper back on the wheels. Remember to have a small check-up on the disc (rotor) for wear and tear.</li>
		</ol>
	</details>
	</section>

	<h3>Chain and Sprocket Change</h3>
	<section class="chain">
		<p>Your chain is what keeping your bike moving, so aside from keeping the tension and the slack to an appropriate mark, you should check for your chain and sprocket wear and tear to see if it needs any replacement. Indicators are: slack is still too large even when the chain adjuster is at max, sprocket teeth are all dulled, chain links wiggling on sprocket, chain links is too rough.</p>
		<details>
			<summary>Put some of your time into research for this list of things you will need</summary>
			<ul>
				<li>New set of chain with/without sprocket.</li>
				<li>Link breaker/riveting tools</li>
				<li>Allen keys (to replace the sprocket)</li>
				<li>Big bolt wrench (for front sprocket)</li>
				<li>Parts tray</li>
				<li>Latex gloves</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
		<p>After you have everything, I assume that when you bought your bike, you have bought your self some bike stands as well. So now it the time to put your bike on your stands.</p>
		<details>
			<summary>Here are the steps</summary>
			<ol>
				<li>Find the master link on your chain, if your chain don't have one, use the chain breaker/riveting tool to break off a link to remove the chain.</li>
				<li>Remove the chain from the bike, but don't throw it out just yet, keep it for now.</li>
				<li>Use your old chain as a length guide to cut your new chain to fit in your bike.</li>
				<li>Unless you are also replacing your sprocket, you should now put your new chain on your bike and rivet the link pins using the riveting tool. If you are replacing your sprocket as well, then continue from here without putting the chain back on.</li>
				<li>Remove the rear wheel from the bike, set it down somewhere padded so you won't damage the rotor.</li>
				<li>Remove the old sprocket out using your allen keys.</li>
				<li>Check for your front sprocket, put your bike in gear and crack loose the bolt holding the front sprocket to remove it.</li>
				<li>Put in your new front and rear sprocket and tighten it well.</li>
				<li>Put your new chain on and rivet the link pins with the riveting tool.</li>
				<li>Give your chain a quick clean up and lubing before running it. (you can refer to the Wash &amp Body Care page for this)</li>
